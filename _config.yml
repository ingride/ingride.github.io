profile: Ingrid wants to make the world simpler. She's starting with Intercom's production systems.
         She talks and cares deeply about demystifying the tech culture and wants to make it more accessible and open.
         She is a DublinJs co-organizer and a mentor for women in tech communities.
         It's not entirely clear if she's really a unicorn whisperer or a vampire, but mentioning them makes bio's less awkward.
         Ingrid knows the Internet is dark and full of terrors, and she promises these are her views, and her views alone.
