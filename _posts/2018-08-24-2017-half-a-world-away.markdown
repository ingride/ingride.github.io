I am a firm believer you feel almost instantly when you belong somewhere. Be it in a job, city, relationship or event. I also believe it can be overpowered by how great of an opportunity something is, a strong belief that anything takes X amount of time, respect, duty, or even, unfortunately, having no other choice.

I appreciate not everyone is guided by this. From my wise (hah!) 30years old this year ( although let's be clear, my mind still feels 21 <a title="ok, most of the time">sometimes </a> ), I was always my happiest and at my best when I felt that way.
It's the purest form of freedom for me, and - realistically - it allows you to shift the brain power you'd put into worrying ( or questions like - am I right to be here? ) into being healthy, happy, have good habits nailed down, and problem solve the shit out of anything.

End of 2017 I started feeling like I am putting my heart, health and soul into things without them going anywhere.
I felt like - with the exception of my friends - I was not getting through, and was not in a position to run at my full potential.  For me, the lack of common ground makes me question myself a lot. I like to think I am realistic enough to know when I'm shit, and that I go into a situation with an open mind. I strongly believe no one knows everything. Period. I also don't give up easily.
The fighter in me stuck to it, raised it, worked on it. It eventually became clear it just wasn't gonna go in a way that works for me. You need common ground to grow and keep sane. And when it's missing, it takes a toll. And it becomes toxic.

So I needed a reset. I packed my Dublin life into 9 ( big ) boxes, and on June 4th, just two weeks after leaving Intercom, I also left Ireland. The short-term simple plan was to first spend some time home, and speak at a conference in Greece. The bigger after-plan was to take a 4months around the world trip.

 I'd been talking about making a change for a while, but only remained in a background thread. The life I've been building in Ireland ( for 5 plus years ) was comfortable. It grew me up, made me stronger, gave me great opportunities, and more importantly, was and is filled with people I love.

Actually leaving felt surreal, and in the beginning was having a hard time feeling completely excited about the change. I had a list of hopes, dreams and plans for Ireland and work, that I knew were not gonna happen.  
I did however feel it was the best and right thing to do. As my friend Ben would say, I needed some rock sitting time to just be. and think :). And I needed it to progress in a faster pace, otherwise I lose interest, change my mind, or procrastinate.
I took the fact that I wasn't freaked out, and managed to keep calm and calculated the entire time, as a positive sign. And it is one of the things I am most proud of.

I am eternally grateful that my friends were incredibly supportive. Them being so understanding, excited and believing in me, gave me strength to keep going when doubts pilled out. I am also grateful that, while I am not
an organizational wizz ( by far! ), my friend Hanna is. She was a big help, and we nailed down the itinerary and cost incredibly fast. Less than a month fast to be more specific. It is the most beautifully logical spreadsheet I've ever put together. Lists work! <a title="Hanna did, but now I do too!"> Who knew? </a>

<h3> [ <font color="#0000ff">first month of... independence</font > ]</h3>

I started with the high ( and slightly insane ) ambition of not really taking a break, and started working on my talk for <a href="https://devitconf.org/" target="_blank" ref="nofollow" > DevIt </a> and on some personal projects pretty much straight away. I've been working since I was 19 and never took more than 3 weeks off at a time. I didn't know what being off looks like, so was trying to feel as productive as possible and not feel like I am wasting time.
The talk is a story I care about deeply, and it kind of wrote itself out easily, but had a harder time keeping motivated to work on anything else. Mostly because my mind was bombarded with trip plans and family time. I decided the best thing to do would be to just stop for ... as long as I needed to, and trust myself I will know when it's time to come back.

<h3> [ <font color="#0000ff"> first month of traveling</font>  ] </h3>

I've traveled alone before ( hooray international conferences ), but never for longer than a week. The concept of not having a job or a constant paycheck to rely on was, and still is, very new to me. I went forward being fully-aware I won't know what to expect, and with the safety net of having booked all the flights and accommodation. I designed the trip to keep me very busy for the first 2 weeks, and allowing myself to just be immersed in the traveling vibe. I suspected Vietnam will allow me to slow down, and that I will hopefully reach Thailand feeling energized, inspired and ready to start tackling the notorious 'what's next' question.

<img src="/assets/images/half-world-away/dubai.jpg" alt="Dubai"/>
I chose Dubai because it's one of the best connected hubs in the world. Every major airline flies to and from Dubai, and allows you to reach most destinations in Asia relatively easy. I didn't have a huge to-see list other than Burj Khalifa and the Marina Bay area. Within the first hour of being there, I got why it became so popular - everyone is friendly, polite and treat each other with respect. And from the moment I saw the downtown area and caught a glimpse of Burj Khalifa, I fell in love.
I find Dubai's growth from a bunch of sand dunes to a metropolis in just 20 years, incredibly fascinating. Walking around, I was amazed by how engineered and thought-out everything was: from the irrigation system for their outdoor gardens ( yes, the downtown is wonderfully green considering you're in a desert ), to getting water all the way to the top of the tallest building in the world.
<br /> Come to think of it now, Dubai is a good poster child for what an impact engineering can have on the world. But what I loved most is the feeling you are respected, valued, and welcomed to be there.
I joked before ( especially after visiting Morocco and Arizona ) that I belong in the desert. There might be some truth to that - the 45 degrees heat felt actually tolerable with drinking a lot of water and covering up - added bonus of also respecting the local culture.
Seeing a sand storm in action is one of the added bonuses of visiting summer time. It felt right out of a proper dystopian movie .
I would go back in a heartbeat.

<img src="/assets/images/half-world-away/hk.jpg" alt="Hong Kong"/>

The first thing I've been saying about Hong Kong is 'OMG, the food!'. I am not by definition a foodie, but Hong Kong converted me. From the less than 5 Dollars cute Michelin Restaurants, to their spin on Chinese Dishes.
I followed a ( what turns out to be ) <a href="https://www.yogawinetravel.com/top-restaurants-to-eat-at-in-hong-kong/" target="_blank" ref="nofollow"> great blog post </a> about the Hong Kong food scene and it didn't disappoint. It took me to great parts of the city, and allowed my jet-lag self to not worry too much about where to eat.
Second, Hong Kong's metro system is just incredible. You don't need anything else ( unless you're like me and love boats. But the metro card will also work with that! ).
The city itself is crazily fast paced - best noticed in restaurants, where everyone eats and leaves quickly - and busy at all times. You're expected to share a table at a restaurant, regardless of the group size. But you can also see it in the packed buildings with tiny apartments - it's all work, and after work fun. You'd think people would be grumpy and tired all the time. Turns out, they seem really happy. Perhaps it is the good food. Or the fact they have actual billboards with tips on how to be joyful. Am not kidding.

And because no great story is complete without an even greater coincidence, I happened to visit HK, when Rise was on. Which, as we found out over Instagram, also brought my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/lakatos88" target="_blank" ref="nofollow"> Laka </a> to town.
Was also exciting to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/charis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" > Charis Rooda </a> and nerd out on our love for communities and culture in tech.
Good chats and food are a match made in travel heaven.

<img src="/assets/images/half-world-away/seoul.jpg" alt="Seoul"/>

Seoul is the city I was most excited about from the beginning. Two words: cuteness overload. Even the metro card is cartoony themed. So are the ice-creams and stores. Much happiness for the girly side of me.
The city is hands down Nirvana for everything face mask and skin care, and there's an entire block with such stores. Not even gonna tell you how much time I spent there! But let's just say it also converts to a food paradise at night. Soooo it was a lot. The struggle to be disciplined and go to other places too was real. VEEERY real!  

Seoul is a fascinating mix of old and new. You can still find an entire neighborhood with houses built in a traditional Korean style ( and using traditional methods ), palaces and monuments celebrating Korea's past. All alongside a really modern skyline and architectural masterpieces like Ewha Womans University ( an incredible underground building ) and the museum of modern art.

Seoul also marked my 10 days traveling. 10 is usually the make it or break it point point for me when I try to form a new habit. It's that time I get tired, anxious, start thinking, start over-thinking, get a <strike> little </strike>
negative. Jet-lag was real, humidity was NOT my friend, I switched 4 timezones, I found reasons!
So I did what any person in such situation would do - I went to a cat cafe.

<b> If the world would have more cat cafes, we'd all be happier! </b> Just sayin, they're on to something.!


<img src="/assets/images/half-world-away/vietnam.jpg" alt="Vietnam"/>

When you do Hong Kong and Seoul in a 10 days combined, two things will happen. First, your brain will be timezone confused. Second, for me, was wanting to visit as much as I can ( there is just SO much to do and all looks SO goooooood! ). Add the jet-lag on top, and it makes for a particularly stressful experience. I was walking around until very late at night every day, and felt like I'm constantly on a run for something.
Turns out, I was right about Vietnam, and getting there made me relax. The air had something that reminded me of Bali ( probably the humidity and gloomy light), and it felt overall, familiar.

Hanoi is one of those places where you can just be, take your time to drink a coffee and eat all the soups. I'm a firm believer Pho cures everything ( just sayin, it worked for years every time I was feeling under the weather ). My Hanoi experience was pretty much channeling my Anthony Bourdain side, and eating. All the time. I grew up inspired by his shows, and it was one of those moments when it (finally) clicked, and got exciting. 'Holy shit, I am actually traveling the world!' kinda thing :) .  

 Besides the food, I chose Hanoi for Sapa and Halong Bay trips. While the latter didn't work out because of all the rain ( monsoon season, you're the worst! ), Sapa is hands down one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. I got rained down for days, and exhibited much creativity in protecting my camera so I can take photos in the pouring rain ( although my camera is weather sealed, it's NOT monsoon sealed! ). Yes, an umbrella would've worked better. Now I know.

In the end, was grateful to escape South, to Hoi An. It reminded me of Venice, with all the cute long boats and lanterns floating around the main river ( and if you know me, you know how much I LOVE Venice ). Hoi An is infinitely more creative, fascinating, and friendly than any other place I visited in Vietnam.
It took me from a lantern festival, to food markets and cooking classes, to shooting in a rice field, and a circus performance. All in just 4 ( too short ) days.

<br />
Here's the insane part about me and taking photos of...anything I am ultimately fascinated by: everything else stops existing. In February this year, I got the flu while at the Venice Carnival. I still went out in the cold for hours, just so I can take more photos and not miss anything. Don't try this - it turned what could've been just a cold, into a proper chest infection that took me out for 2 weeks. I regret nothing.   
<br /> In Vietnam, I forgot to drink water for almost an entire day. In 35 degrees weather with 90% humidity. I didn't feel it at the time because I was in a rice field and it was pretty.
I started feeling drained only two days later. I thought it was strange since I had lots of water since, and it was genuinely a time I had a lot of energy (and was eating and sleeping well) . I tried drinking more water, and taking vitamins. Nothing was working.
I missed most of Ho Chi Minh because of it. It got to a point where I wasn't sure what to do or what is going on, until I saw almost all the locals drink something best described as a 'salty lemon' drink.  My diet is very low on sodium ( on purpose ), and so is, on average, the Vietnamese cuisine. Turns out, you lose a lot of salt and minerals ( not just water ) in high humidity, and drinking water can actually be counter-productive. The same <strike> delicious </strike> salty lemon drink made me feel better within hours after trying it.

<img src="/assets/images/half-world-away/bangkok.jpg" alt="Seoul"/>

I've been talking with different people about Bangkok and was really impressed by the city within minutes: beautiful buildings, good coffee, really sweet people. Not to mention the best way to reach the touristy places ( like the Grand Palace ) is by a hop-on, hop-off boat ( boats, boats, boats! ). But more importantly, I have a huge respect for the incredible attention to details found in any temple decorations. Seeing the Grand Palace up close is truly breath-taking. Takes patience ( which I don't have lots of), and dedication ( which...sometimes...meh ) to create something like that.
Unfortunately my previous humidity and lack of salt adventures, combined with AC pointing at me while I sleep ( I hate AC with passion ), and being in very crowded places, got me sick for a second time. This time it was proper flu, and it completely messed up my plans to enjoy Bangkok. Sad Ingrid is sad.

<img src="/assets/images/half-world-away/samui.jpg" alt="Koh Samui"/>

My 2 weeks oasis. Samui was way way colder and quieter this time a year - something I was really really! grateful for. I flew out there sick and miserable, and recovered faster than I expected. I suspect my dragon fruit, papaya & watermelon daily routine had something to do with it. It turns out, I was also right that I will start reconnecting with real-world and tech while here. There's nothing quite like the sound of waves as background music. The beach has been my office for 2 weeks.

<h3> [ <font color="#0000ff">  self-review time. </font> ] </h3>
<h4> What I've done well </h4>
<br /> - I anticipated correctly I'll start resurfacing to real world and tech while in Thailand. Makes me think I've done something right in my planning. And that after all, I know myself pretty well. Small wins.
<br /> - I got vaccinated for all the things scary in Dublin. It took me 2 weeks and a non trivial amount of money. It allows me to not be paranoid about food markets. It also kept me (mostly) calm when I got sick, knowing it was probably just a cold.
<br /> - I've started working out again,
<br /> - I read for at least 1h every day
<br /> - I got tanned. Horray! It is VERY rare!

<h4> What I could've done / could do better: </h4>
<br /> - I completely fucked up my visa application for Vietnam, and it ended up costing me quite a bit to fix it fast. It was sign I was unfocused ( or focused on the wrong things ), and am overall glad it happened. It gave me clarity.
<br /> - drink more water, but more importantly, the salt and minerals intake.
<br /> - I still! go to bed very late, and wake up later than I would like. I find it SO hard to fix, and it's the number one priority at the moment.
<br />- this post was supposed to go live start of August, but new and shiny things are distracting. Working remotely is new to me. Could do with more discipline.

<h4> Lessons learned </h4>
<br /> - I don't know if there is a right time for something big to happen. Truthfully, I don't think I believe in it. But being deliberate does save you a shit ton of stress. More than anything, valuing your sanity above everything else, always setting an intention and having a clear answer for the 'WHY' behind a decision are my new mantras.   
<br /> - here's a funny one for ya: I didn't really use conditioner before. I used other things and was happy. The humidity came. Conditioner rules! I'm a believer now.
<br /> - salt, salt, salt. And in case it wasn't clear enough: salt! Oh and then more salt. And minerals!
<br /> - and ending with a confession : every time I fucked something up ( like my visa application ), or woke up later than I initially intended, or whatever was going differently than expected, I was ruthless to myself. Just plain negative- I should do better, know better, why wasn't I doing it, what's wrong with me. Truth be told, I was skeptical from the beginning this trip will go well ( it all happened so fast ), and expected failures.

All is now past tense. Being in bed sick the entire day, in a hotel room away from anyone I know and trust, gave me some perspective. Doubting yourself is a dead-end. Serves no purpose, just adds stress. The truth is, taking my time and trusting I will know when it's right really worked so far. I won't go saying 'listen to your gut feeling'. I will instead say that taking yourself as you are and working with it is infinitely more productive and healthy! It was not an easy one to learn, but is perhaps my most important lesson to date.
